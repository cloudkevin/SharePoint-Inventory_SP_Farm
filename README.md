# SharePoint-Inventory_SP_Farm

To run the full inventory, load this script in PowerShell, then enter: Run-FullInventory -DestinationFolder "c:\temp" -LogFilePrefix "YourFarm_"

Just make sure that the destination folder (and drive) has enough space for the log files (gigs in some cases), and that your LogFilePrefix is appropriate
